Restaurant Rating Prediction

ask-1 Objective (Machine Learning Project – Restaurant Rating Prediction)

Objective:
To build a machine learning model that can predict the aggregate rating of a restaurant based on various features like cuisine type, price range, and other metadata.

Key Goals:
1)Import and understand the dataset

Load the restaurant dataset using pandas

Understand its structure: columns, data types, and null values

2)Preprocess the dataset

Handle missing values

Convert text data (like Cuisines, City, etc.) into numerical form using encoding (e.g., LabelEncoder)

Drop irrelevant or unnecessary columns (like Restaurant ID)

3)Feature selection

Choose relevant columns (features) that help in predicting the Aggregate rating

Separate features (X) and target (y)

4)Split the dataset

Use train_test_split to divide data into training and testing sets

5)Train a regression model

Use a machine learning algorithm like Linear Regression, Random Forest, or Decision Tree to train the model

6)Evaluate the model

Use metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² Score to assess the performance

7)User input prediction

Allow a user to input new values (like cuisine, price range)

Predict the rating using the trained model

8)Interpretation of the result

Show how close the predicted rating is to real-world expectations
